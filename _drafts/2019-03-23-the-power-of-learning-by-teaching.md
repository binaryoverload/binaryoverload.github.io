tl;dr. By attempting to explain concepts to other people, you in turn form better ways to explain the concepts and therefore have a greater understanding of the concepts themselves.

Now that you've read that disclaimer and you're no longer thinking "This maniac wants me to learn things from scratch by teaching other people!" (While it is true I am an maniac, I don't express that in blog posts); let us get down to business. 

From my experience, this sort of effect comes from one of two places:
 - Tutoring (Teaching) other people either 1-to-1 or 1-to-few
 - Explaining something to a fellow student (Or anyone who is in a similar position of knowledge to you)

I'm sure there are many more places this comes from but I can only comment on what I have experienced and observed personally. 

### Tutoring
> For this I'm going to assume you're tutoring someone of lesser ability to yourself in my case that is a student from lower down in the school

Tutoring comes a unique experience in that you are placed in a position of relative power to the other person(s) and with that comes a responsibility.
