> **Disclaimer:** This article is based on my experience working with smaller companies and schools in the UK. With larger companies, roles are spread out between more people which reduces the complexity of day-to-day tasks.

For the past 10 months, I have been working at a secondary school in the UK as the sole IT Technician. Working in this position has taught me a number of lessons and has also given me more insight into why previous support companies have failed to provide the proper support.

 - Being an IT Support person is not neccasarily difficult in itself
 - The difficulty comes with both the huge breadth of knowledge and the volume of requests that you would get.
