tl;dr. By attempting to explain concepts to other people, you in turn form better ways to explain the concepts and therefore have a greater understanding of the concepts themselves.

Now that you've read that disclaimer and you're no longer thinking "This maniac wants me to learn things from scratch by teaching other people!" (While it is true I am an maniac, I don't express that in blog posts); let us get down to business. 

From my experience, this sort of effect comes from one of two places:

* Tutoring (Teaching) other people either 1-to-1 or 1-to-few
* Explaining something to a fellow student (Or anyone who is in a similar position of knowledge to you)

I'm sure there are many more places this comes from but I can only comment on what I have experienced and observed personally. 

### Tutoring

> For this I'm going to assume you're tutoring someone of lesser ability to yourself. In my case, that is a student from lower down in the school.

Tutoring comes a unique experience in that you are placed in a position of relative power to the other person(s) and with that comes a responsibility.

Since the other party is not as knowledgeable as you in the subject, they will likely look up to you in a way and trust that what you're saying is true. I think this responsibility of not feeding a person the wrong information puts a lot of people off tutoring; they are afraid that they don't know "everything" as so are unable to teach someone. This is not completely true - tutoring is not just knowing the subject area but being able to explain a concept to someone in an understandable manner. As a tutor, you also need to be admit that you don't know or that you are wrong. If you can't admit that you are wrong, you can comprise the tutee's trust in you which will make teaching them anything a **lot** harder.
