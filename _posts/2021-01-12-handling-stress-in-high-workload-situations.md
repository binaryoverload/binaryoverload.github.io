As part of my work, I sometimes have to handle quite high loads of work. For those who do not know, I work as the network manager for a secondary school where I am responsible for receiving all technical support requests from parents, staff and students. 

Because of this, I have certain mechanisms in place for myself to prevent myself completely going ðŸ’¥!

> **Disclaimer:** While these mechanisms may work for me, they will not work for everyone! Please don't  overwork yourself unneccasarily! Keeping up high workloads (Even with appropriate mechanisms in place) for extended periods of time can be detrimental to your mental health. Take care of yourself!
