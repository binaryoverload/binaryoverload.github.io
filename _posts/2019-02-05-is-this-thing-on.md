title: Hey, is this thing on?
---

Is probably one of the most common title used for a first blog post. Along with "Hello world", it's a interesting way to hook people into reading the first blog post a maker or developer writes. If you're here, it's either cause I've asked you to look at this shiny new thing I've made or you've been dragged in by a title *slightly* more interesting than "First blog post".

Either way, I'm glad you're here! And I hope you'll stay long enough to take an occasional glance at my *hopefully* interesting posts.

### What can you expect from me?

Well... I'm not sure at the moment. What is certain is that almost all of my blog posts will be small; each post will probably be a 5 minute read or less. This will be for two reasons:
1. So I don't get easily bored of writing (And trust me, it would happen)
2. Being concise is important and will make sure I am getting my point across as effectively and non-waffely (It's not a word but it should be) as possible.

Making promises about how often I will post wouldn't be a good idea but I should *hopefully* be doing one post each month.

Some posts I have lined up to do will be "lessons" on real life interactions with other people (*Crazy*, I know. Looking at all you developers). I frame "lessons" *very* vaguely because I will base everything off my own experience which, in comparison to some, will be quite limited. Hopefully, I will at least bring up some points that might make you think about yourself and how *you* interact with other people!

Anyway, I've waffled on for long enough! 

Look out for my next blog post: **The power of learning by teaching**!
